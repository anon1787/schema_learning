# Schema learning

This is a project exploring learning a schema from a flat table..

The project is primarily written in rust.

## Usage

With rust installed. Go to the schema_learning subdirectory. Run

    cargo run --release name_of_a.csv

There are a number of parameters than can be set. The most convenient option is to use the run_on_data_file.py script in the scripts directory. It uses a hardcoded path in the script, so please change the hardcoded directory to an appropriate one.
